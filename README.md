# Fedora-Setup a Post Install Helper Script

## What's all this then?

Fedora-Setup is a personal script I created to help with post install tasks such as tweaks and software installs. It's written in Bash and utilises Dialog for a friendlier menu system.

Dialog must be installed for the menu system to work and as such the script will check to see if Dialog is installed. If not, it will ask you to install it.

## Usage
1. Set the script to be executable `chmod -x fedora-setup.sh` \
2. Run the script `./fedora-setup.sh`

## Files

- **flatpak-packages.txt** - This file contains a list of all flat packages to install on the system. you can customise this with your choice of applications by application-id.
- **flatpak-packages-user.txt** - This file contains a list of all flat packages to install as user. you can customise this with your choice of applications by application-id.
- **dnf-packages.txt** - This file contains a list of all applications that will be installed via the Fedora and RPMFusion repositories.
